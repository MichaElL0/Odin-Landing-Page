# Odin Landing Page

Simple front landing page with basic layout for exercising Flexbox skills.

## Technologies

I used HTML, CSS. Layout was done with Flexbox.

## Experience

I learned a lot with this project about flexbox and how to layout basic website and have everything aligned and centered correctly like in the example image. Great fun some frustrations but I think did good job at the end.
